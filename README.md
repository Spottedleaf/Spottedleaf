### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my work is centered around improving performance for the Minecraft dedicated server, specifically with [Paper](https://papermc.io/), [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) and previously with [Starlight](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight).

### Work
